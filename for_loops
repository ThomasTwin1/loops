#  For Loops
# The placeholder variable stores the value of the targeted variable containing the list
# The loop on iterates one time per value within a list
# Always use similar naming conventions when making a placeholder variable
# For example:
thomas_family = ["Rod", "Tiera", "Kai", "Kairo", "Kaila", "Kailee", "Kayo"]
for member in thomas_family:
    print(member.title() + " Thomas\n".title())
# The placeholder variable member is a family member in the thomas_family variable
# The placeholder variable should be a singular and the targeted variable plural. This makes the code easy to read.
# More examples:
# for fruit in fruits:, for shark in sharks:, for card in cards:
# Don't forget to put the colon at the end of the for loop statement
# The code inside the loop should be indented with 4 spaces
# Lastly you can print a statement to regarding the for loop outside the loop
thomas_family = ["Rod", "Tiera", "Kai", "Kairo", "Kaila", "Kailee", "Kayo"]
for member in thomas_family:
    print(member.title() + " Thomas\n".title())
print(f"Hello {', '.join(thomas_family[:-1])} and {thomas_family[-1]}!")

# Here is another example of the code:
# Define the Thomas family list
thomas_family = ["Rod", "Tiera", "Kai", "Kairo", "Kaila", "Kailee", "Kayo"]

# Print each family member's name with "Thomas" appended
for member in thomas_family:
    print(f"{member.title()} Thomas\n")

# Print a greeting statement for the entire family
print(f"Hello {', '.join(thomas_family[:-1])} and {thomas_family[-1]}!")
